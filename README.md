# CAD exercises in FreeCAD
Bart Massey 2021

I ran across a [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCAD/comments/rcipma/hi_guys_im_new_with_this_software_and_i_have_to/) today talking about some
apparently-classic ![exercises](exercises.jpg) for designing and machining
that date way back. These exercises were being used with
FreeCAD, and it looked interesting…

One major nerdsnipe later, here are my solutions to a few
selected exercises in FreeCAD. I don't claim they are good,
but they seem to at least capture the thing asked for in
each case. I learned a bit from doing them, and really
brushed up my dusty FreeCAD skills.
